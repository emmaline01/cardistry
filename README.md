# cardistry

Start the frontend by going into the cardistry-app directory and running "yarn start" (with yarn installed)
Check out the readme in cardistry-app for more info.

Start the backend by running app.py.


Make sure to start the backend and frontend concurrently for the app to work (or otherwise you may get a 500 ECONNREFUSED error)
