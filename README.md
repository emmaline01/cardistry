# Cardistry web app

A web app that will track the cardistry moves I've learnt.


## To run the app

Start the frontend by going into the cardistry-app directory and running "yarn start" (with yarn installed). Check out the readme in cardistry-app for more info. Start the backend by running api/app.py. Make sure to start the backend and frontend concurrently for the app to work (or otherwise you may get a 500 ECONNREFUSED error)


## Technologies used

React (JavaScript) for the frontend, Flask (Python) for the backend, Microsoft Azure for SQL database hosting
